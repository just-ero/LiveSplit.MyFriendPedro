# My Friend Pedro (2019) Autosplitter

# Known bugs:

* At first startup, timer starts during loading

Solution: Before run, it is necessary to enter any level and exit. 
This problem appears due to fact that when you first start level some value that uses timer during loading doesn't work.

# Instructions

Afterwards, create your splits/segments. Name them anything you want. Or use [template split file](https://github.com/partoftheworlD/MyFriendPedro_autosplitter/blob/master/My%20Friend%20Pedro%20-%20Any%25%20template.lss).

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.
