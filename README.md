# My Friend Pedro (2019) Autosplitter

# Instructions

After activating the MFP autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits/segments. Name them anything you want. Or use [template split file](https://github.com/partoftheworlD/MyFriendPedro_autosplitter/blob/master/My%20Friend%20Pedro%20-%20Any%25%20template.lss).

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

Make sure you have the split checkmarked as explained above. If that doesn't work, or if a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact me.
